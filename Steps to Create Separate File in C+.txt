Steps to Create Separate File in C++ and import inside main.cpp file

1. Create main file
2. create another file with extension .h (I created shape.h)
3. Save both file at same place
4. import shape.h in main program (inside .cpp file)
5. (#include iostream.h and using namespace std) these two header file should be inside both files
6. Always Run .cpp file
***************************
		Example in my  program
1. I created Calculate Area of Different Shapes.cpp  which is maim file
2. shape.h which is to be imported inside Calculate Area of Different Shapes.cpp
